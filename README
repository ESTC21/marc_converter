This file is part of the ESTC Record Importer package, a server 
daemon that processes incoming MARC cataloging data stored in binary
MARC, .csv, and .txt formats, checks the records for scope on date,
language, and place of publication, and exports the filtered
records as RDF suitable for linked data exchange.
