This file is part of the ESTC Record Importer package, a server 
daemon that processes incoming MARC cataloging data stored in binary
MARC, .csv, and .txt formats, checks the records for scope on date,
language, and place of publication, and exports the filtered
records as RDF suitable for linked data exchange.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
------------------

--when running, need to pass an argument 'export' or 'import' to tell the 
system which process should run

--for MARC record import, need to set the correct flag for holding, bib, 
or orphan around line 96 of LoadMarc.java.  Future forward I should set this
as a runtime argument.  Better yet, it would read the file and make a 
determination on its own.  This should be possible because the records look
different than holding records and there is no ESTC number in the record
as there are with BIBs, so I should be able to set on-the-fly.
